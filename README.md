###Drag & Drop functionality in AngularJS, no jQuery required

[Demo](http://caitp.github.io/angular-drop) | [Docs](http://caitp.github.io/angular-drop/docs)

AngularDrop provides simple building blocks for Drag & Drop functionality in AngularJS.

Drag & Drop is a fairly complex user interaction, even though it might seem trivial initially. It is further complicated in AngularJS by the concept of scopes, which can have a major impact on the content of a drag/dropped node.

I do not claim to have the answers to any or all of the questions raised by implementing drag & drop functionality in a complex application, but I am interested in finding out so that we can deliver the best experience possible to users of our apps.

With the best intentions, it is hoped that we will be able to deliver:

- Full support for mobile applications
- Cleverly handling scope-changing
- Scope events fired when elements are dragged and dropped
- Support for dragging and dropping between nested browsing contexts
- Support for dragging and dropping between different windows

This library is not simply a pair of directives, but is in fact also building blocks for creating custom directives with specialized Drag & Drop behaviour.

###Installation

Angular-drop is now registered on bower! You can install, as you'd expect, like so:

```bash
bower install angular-drop --save
```

If you prefer to get the package using more traditional means, the gh-pages branch contains everything you'd need. You can get at those [here](https://github.com/caitp/angular-drop/tree/gh-pages)


###Contributing

I'd be grateful for any form of contribution, whether it be the creation of demo pages, bug reports, documentation, feature requests, or above all else, patches.

Patches should follow the [Google JavaScript Style Guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml), and each and every new feature or bug fix should incorporate one or more meaningful tests to assist in preventing future regressions.

While you may, if you so wish, discuss this module anywhere you like, I will be most likely to respond to inquiries directed to me on IRC (particularly in #angularjs on irc.freenode.net), or on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/caitp/angular-drop/issues).
